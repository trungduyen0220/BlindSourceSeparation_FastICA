# BlindSourceSeparation_FastICA

Blind Source Separation (BSS) refers to a problem where both the sources and the mixing methodology are unknown, only mixture signals are available for further separation process. In several situations it is desirable to recover all individual sources from the mixed signal, or at least to segregate a particular source.

FastICA is an efficient and popular algorithm for independent component analysis invented by Aapo Hyv√§rinen at Helsinki University of Technology.
